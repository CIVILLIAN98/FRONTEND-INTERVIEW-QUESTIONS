    <h1>Interview questions</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?
        <p>var object = Object.create(null);</p>
        <p>var object = Object.create(null);</p>
        <p>
          var object = { name: "Sudheer", age: 34 };
          <br />
          Object literal property values can be of any data type, including
          array, function, and nested object.
        </p>
        <p>
          function Person(name) { this.name = name; this.age = 21; } var object
          = new Person("Sudheer");
        </p>
        <p>
          function Person() {} Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer"; var object =
          new Person();
        </p>
        <p>function func() {}; new func(x, y, z);</p>
        <p>
          ES6 Class syntax: ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          class Person { constructor(name) { this.name = name; } } var object =
          new Person("Sudheer");
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is a prototype chain? <br />
        <p>
          Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on
          existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind?
        <p>
          Call: The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and
          arguments provided one by one
        </p>
        <p>
          Apply: Invokes the function with a given this value and allows you to
          pass in arguments as an array
        </p>
        <p>
          bind: returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of
          arguments
        </p>
        <p>
          Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current
          function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send
          in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember
          by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array.
          Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the
          first parameter passed to bind().
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is JSON and its common operations?
        <p>
          JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax,
          which was popularized by Douglas Crockford. It is useful when you want
          to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file
          with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the purpose of the array slice method?
        <p>
          The slice() method returns the selected elements in an array as a new
          array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start
          argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without
          including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it
          selects till the end.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the purpose of the array splice method?
        <p>
          The splice() method is used either adds/removes items to/from an
          array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies
          the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the optional
          second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each
          additional argument is added to the array.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>What is the difference between slice and splice?</li>
      <table border="1px">
        <tr>
          <th>Slice</th>
          <th>Splice</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Doesn't modify the original array(immutable)</td>
          <td>Modifies the original array(mutable)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Returns the subset of original array</td>
          <td>Returns the deleted elements as array</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Used to pick the elements from array</td>
          <td>Used to insert or delete elements to/from array</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <li>
        How do you compare Object and Map?
        <p>
          Objects are similar to Maps in that both let you set keys to values,
          retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is
          stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps
          historically. But there are important differences that make using a
          Map preferable in certain cases.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between == and === operators
        <p>
          JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=)
          equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in
          consideration, while non-strict operators make type
          correction/conversion based upon values of variables.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are lambda or arrow functions
        <p>
          An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and
          does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. These
          functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be
          used as constructors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        what is "first ordered function" ? <br />
        <p>
          First-order function is a function that doesn’t accept another
          function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return
          value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is "High ordered function" ? <br />
        <p>
          Higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as
          an argument or returns a function as a return value or both.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is a unary function? <br />
        <p>
          Unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that accepts exactly one
          argument. It stands for a single argument accepted by a function.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the currying function? <br />
        <p>
          Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments
          and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single
          argument. Currying is named after a mathematician Haskell Curry. By
          applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is a pure function? <br />
        <p>
          A Pure function is a function where the return value is only
          determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call
          a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number
          of places in the application then it will always return the same
          value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the purpose of the let keyword? <br />
        <p>
          The let statement declares a block scope local variable. Hence the
          variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block,
          statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables
          declared with the var keyword used to define a variable globally, or
          locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between let and var? <br />
        You can list out the differences in a tabular format <br />
        <table border="1px">
          <tr>
            <th>var</th>
            <th>let</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript</td>
            <td>Introduced as part of ES6</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>It has function scope</td>
            <td>It has block scope</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Variables will be hoisted</td>
            <td>Hoisted but not initialized</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword? <br />
        <p>
          let is a mathematical statement that was adopted by early programming
          languages like Scheme and Basic. It has been borrowed from dozens of
          other languages that use let already as a traditional keyword as close
          to var as possible.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you redeclare variables in switch block without an error?<br />
        <p>
          If you try to redeclare variables in a switch block then it will cause
          errors because there is only one block.To avoid this error, you can
          create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block
          scoped lexical environment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the Temporal Dead Zone
        <br />
        <p>
          The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when
          declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with
          var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its
          declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span
          when that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and
          its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?<br />
        <p>
          IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript
          function that runs as soon as it is defined.The primary reason to use
          an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared
          within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you
          try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is a cookie?
        <p>
          A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be
          accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Why do you need a cookie?
        <p>
          Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such
          as username). It basically involves two steps, When a user visits a
          web page
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>the user profile can be stored in a cookie.</li>
          <li>
            Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user
            profile.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the options in a cookie?
        <p>
          Option Cookie is the default behavior for EZproxy when handling
          cookies. With this option enabled, EZproxy will pass through cookies
          that do not include a domain, but intercept and handle cookies that do
          include a domain. The intercepted cookies are stored as part of the
          user session on the EZproxy server.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you delete a cookie?
        <p>
          You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date.
          You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session
        storage?
        <img
          src="./cookie.png"
          alt="differences"
          style="width: 872px; height: 300px; margin: 0 auto"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?
        <p>
          LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data
          even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration
          time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page
          session ends.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you access web sessionStorage?
        <p>
          The Window object implements the WindowLocalStorage and
          WindowSessionStorage objects which has
          localStorage(window.localStorage) and
          sessionStorage(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These
          properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which
          data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and
          storage type (session or local).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the methods available on session storage?
        <p>
          The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing
          the session data
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is a storage event and its event handler?
        <p>
          The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been
          changed in the context of another document. Whereas onstorage property
          is an EventHandler for processing storage events.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Why do you need web sessionStorage?
        <p>
          Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored
          locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information
          is never transferred to the server. Hence this is a more recommended
          approach than Cookies.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you check web storage browser support?
        <p>
          You need to check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage
          before using web storage
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between Element and Component?
        <p>
          React Element does not have any methods, making it light and faster to
          render than components.
        </p>
