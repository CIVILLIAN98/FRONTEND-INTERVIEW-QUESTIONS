    <h1>Interview questions</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?
        <p>var object = Object.create(null);</p>
        <p>var object = Object.create(null);</p>
        <p>
          var object = { name: "Sudheer", age: 34 };
          <br />
          Object literal property values can be of any data type, including
          array, function, and nested object.
        </p>
        <p>
          function Person(name) { this.name = name; this.age = 21; } var object
          = new Person("Sudheer");
        </p>
        <p>
          function Person() {} Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer"; var object =
          new Person();
        </p>
        <p>function func() {}; new func(x, y, z);</p>
        <p>
          ES6 Class syntax: ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          class Person { constructor(name) { this.name = name; } } var object =
          new Person("Sudheer");
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is a prototype chain? <br />
        <p>
          Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on
          existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind?
        <p>
          Call: The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and
          arguments provided one by one
        </p>
        <p>
          Apply: Invokes the function with a given this value and allows you to
          pass in arguments as an array
        </p>
        <p>
          bind: returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of
          arguments
        </p>
        <p>
          Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current
          function immediately. You need to decide whether itâ€™s easier to send
          in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember
          by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array.
          Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the
          first parameter passed to bind().
        </p>

        What is JSON and its common operations?
        <p>
          JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax,
          which was popularized by Douglas Crockford. It is useful when you want
          to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file
          with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the purpose of the array slice method?
        <p>
          The slice() method returns the selected elements in an array as a new
          array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start
          argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without
          including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it
          selects till the end.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the purpose of the array splice method?
        <p>
          The splice() method is used either adds/removes items to/from an
          array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies
          the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the optional
          second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each
          additional argument is added to the array.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>What is the difference between slice and splice?</li>
      <table border="1px">
        <tr>
          <th>Slice</th>
          <th>Splice</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Doesn't modify the original array(immutable)</td>
          <td>Modifies the original array(mutable)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Returns the subset of original array</td>
          <td>Returns the deleted elements as array</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Used to pick the elements from array</td>
          <td>Used to insert or delete elements to/from array</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <li>
        How do you compare Object and Map?
        <p>
          Objects are similar to Maps in that both let you set keys to values,
          retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is
          stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps
          historically. But there are important differences that make using a
          Map preferable in certain cases.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between == and === operators
        <p>
          JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=)
          equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in
          consideration, while non-strict operators make type
          correction/conversion based upon values of variables.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are lambda or arrow functions
        <p>
          An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and
          does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. These
          functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be
          used as constructors.
